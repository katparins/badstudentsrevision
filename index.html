	<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
	<p id="two">The <span style="color: #FFBF00">"Bad Students"</span> movement in Thailand is a student-led<br>social and political movement that emerged in 2020, calling<br>for <span style="color: #FFBF00">reforms in the Thai education system</span> and democracy in<br>the country. The movement seeks to address a wide range<br>of issues in the Thai education system, including the lack of<br>academic freedom, the high cost of education, and the<br>limited opportunities for critical thinking and creativity. The<br>movement also advocates for <span style="color: #FFBF00">greater political reform</span> and<br>transparency in government, calling for a new constitution,<br>an end to military influence in politics, and the protection<br>of human rights.</p>

	<p id="three">Despite facing obstacles and repression, the "Bad Students"<br>movement has continued to gain momentum and has<br>inspired other social and political movements in Thailand.<br>Through their activism and protests, these students have<br>become a symbol of hope and change for many people in<br>Thailand, demonstrating the power of youth-led movements<br>in shaping the future of their country.</p>
