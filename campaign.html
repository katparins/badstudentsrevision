	<h6 id="hair">Ugly Haircut</h6>
	<p id=four>In Thailand, <span style="color: #FFBF00">school haircut rules</span> have been a source of<br>controversy and criticism for many years. Traditionally, boys<br>have been required to keep their hair short, while girls have<br>been required to tie their hair back or wear it in a certain style.<br>As part of the “Bad Students” protest, many students have<br>chosen to adopt a<span style="color: #FFBF00"> distinctive androgynous haircut,</span> which<br>has become a symbol of resistance and solidarity. This haircut<br>challenges traditional ideas about gender and appearance<br>and has become a powerful symbol of the fight for greater<br>democracy and freedom in Thailand.</p>

	<p id=five><span style="color: #FFBF00">School uniform rules</span> in Thailand are taken very seriously, and<br>students are expected to follow them strictly. The typical<br>uniform consists of a white shirt or blouse and a dark-colored<br>skirt or pants. Students are also required to wear black shoes<br>and socks. However, the “Bad Students” movement calls for a<br>more relaxed dress code and <span style="color: #FFBF00">greater freedom of expression</span><br>for students. We argue that the strict uniform rules are a<br>symbol of the authoritarian culture in Thai schools and that<br>they stifle individuality and creativity.</p>

	<h7 id="rainbow">Pride Parade</h7>
	<p id=six>The “Bad Students” movement has been vocal supporting<br><span style="color: #FFBF00">LGBTQ students and their rights.</span> LGBTQ students in Thailand<br>often face discrimination and bullying in schools, and the<br>movement has called for an end to this mistreatment. We<br>argue that all students, regardless of their sexual orientation<br>or gender identity, should be treated equally. The movement<br>has also been critical of the <span style="color: #FFBF00">lack of sex education</span> in schools,<br>which contributes to a lack of understanding and acceptance<br>of LGBTQ individuals. By promoting greater awareness and<br>acceptance of diversity, schools can create a safer and more<br>inclusive environment for all students.</p>
